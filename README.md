# 2PI-effective-action
Numerical solution of the stationary conditions of 2PI effective action

Here two codes are presented. They solve differeintial-integral equations. These differential integral equations are derrived as the stationarity condition imposed on 2-particle-irreducible effective action.

This action is quantum corrected effective action of the complex scalar field with quartic interaction. The 2PI functional depends on two functions, namely, an expectation of the complex scalar field \phi(t, x), and on the connected part of the two-point Green's function G(t_1,x_1,t_2,x_2).

As an initial condition for the mean-field valuse of the Bose-Einstein condensate solution was choosen, and for the Green's function we took Green's function in the background of the mean-field.
